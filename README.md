# Tech task
## It is simple meeting planning calendar for a meeting room in your office.
Github-pages: https://qwiz1.github.io/internship/

For this calendar, used LocalStorage as the basis for storing event information.

Implemented the possibility:

[1]: add new event
[2]: delete existing
[3]: sort by specific person (so far it doesn't work exactly as I wanted)
[4]: the ability to drag meetings with the mouse
