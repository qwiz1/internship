# Tech task
### It is simple meeting planning calendar for a meeting room in your office.
#### Github-pages: https://qwiz1.github.io/internship/

For this calendar, used LocalStorage as the basis for storing event information.

Implemented the possibility:

* add new event;
* delete existing;
* sort by specific person (so far it doesn't work exactly as I wanted);
* the ability to drag meetings with the mouse.
